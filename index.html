  <h1>Hi, I'm Derek.</h1>

  <p>
	  I work in the curation, management, analysis, and visualization of data, mainly to understand complex systems in biotech R&amp;D. I'm currently employed at a large multinational corporation, previously I was a contractor doing similar work, and before that working as a bioinformatician in a hospital research department.
  </p>
  
  <p>
	  I have a "pretty much D" from the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities in Plant and Microbial Biology, where my thesis was focused on understanding how varying environmental conditions affect mutualisms. I decided to leave the program after 5 years and take a Master's on the way out. Previously I was a research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Plant Physiology, after completeing a BSc in Biochemistry and Minor in German from University of Wisconsin-Madison.
  </p>

  <p>
	  I also spend a lot of time thinking about developing sustainable / regenerative / resilient ecosystems, and am working to transition our family farm to such a system.

<h2>Projects</h2>

<h3>mealslurry</h3>

During grad school I developed a framework for eating that I call <a href=http://mealslurry.com> mealslurry</a>. Briefly, it's been optimized for cost, time, mental energy, and nutrition. I've been using it since October 2016, and I've found it to be incredibly helpful in reducing cognitive burden around eating.

<h3>EditR</h3>

<p>
I got involved with <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/mitchell-kluesner-80516589/>Mitch Kluesner's</a> project in developing an algorithm to use Sanger sequencing to quantify the amount of editing in cells modified with <a href=https://benchling.com/pub/liu-base-editor>base editing technology</a>. The amount of editing is normally quantified using Illumina sequencing, costing much more and taking more time than the cheap (~$3 / sample) and fast (1 day) Sanger sequencing method. I refactored Mitch's algorithm in R and wrote a Shiny web app to make it more user friendly and widely available to the community.
